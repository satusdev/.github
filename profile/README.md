> **Swift solutions for faster development**

Welcome to **Satus** — Latin for _swift_. We’re an open source organization on a
mission to speed up development for developers and teams everywhere. Our tools,
libraries, and CLI utilities help you move fast without sacrificing quality — so
you spend less time configuring and more time creating.

## 🚀 Our Mission

- ⚡ **Speed** → Minimize setup time and boilerplate so you can focus on writing
  code.
- 🔧 **Simplicity** → Provide intuitive, well-documented tools that “just work.”
- 🤝 **Community** → Foster an inclusive environment for contributors to learn,
  grow, and collaborate.
- ✅ **Quality** → Uphold best practices, rigorous testing, and excellent
  documentation.
